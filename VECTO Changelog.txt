VECTO ?.? (future release)
- User Manual: "Don't use secondary retarder if retarder losses are already defined in transmission loss maps"
- Gearbox Rules must be set when loading .gbx file to aviod invalid settings (e.g. AT with Skip Gears)
- Correct Pg and Proll calculation (Road gradient)??

VECTO x.x (current source - next release)
- Bugfix: FC interpolation failed when load points matched map points exactly.
- Bugfix: Invalid "FC= -10000!" errors when outside of FC-Map
- FC extrapolation will not abort calculation. Invalid FC values are marked in output as "ERROR".
- Same job file list for BATCH and STANDARD (Job file list does not change when switching mode)
- Changes in header and new parameters in modal results (.vmod):
	o engine speed > n
	o torque > Tq_eng
	o New: Tq_clutch = torque before clutch
	o New: Tq_full = full load torque
	o New: Tq_drag = drag torque
	o Removed: Pe_norm, n_norm	
- No abortion if transmission output and input torque have different signs (In>0, Out<0). (Caused "Transmission Loss Map invalid" error messages)
- Bugfix: Error if Look-Ahead Coasting was disabled.
- Eco-Roll revised:
	o Engages if Pwheel < 0
	o Disengages if Underspeed is reached.
- Improved gear shift model for torque converter
- Updates in torque converter [IN DEVELOPMENT]
- Look-Ahead Coasting now uses real coasting also if road gradient > 0 which means the coasting deceleration can be so high that no braking is necessary. In this case the braking phase will be ommitted and the total deceleration time can be shorter than expected by the given target coasting deceleration.
