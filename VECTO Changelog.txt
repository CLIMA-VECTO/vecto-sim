VECTO 1.1 beta - 06.02.2013
- New independent licensing dll replaces TUG's version
- Speed values below 0.09km/h are set to 0km/h
- Gear shift polygon model
	o Replaces old gear shift model!
	o New parameters in .vgbx file including path to gear shift polygons file
	o Old gear shift model parameters removed from .vecto file
- Command Line Arguments processing:
	o Changed prefix form "/" to "-"
	o Bugfix: Argument "-run" was not processed
