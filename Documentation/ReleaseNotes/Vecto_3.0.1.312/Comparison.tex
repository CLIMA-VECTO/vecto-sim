\section{Comparing Vecto 2.2 and Vecto 3.0.1} % (fold)
\label{sec:comparison_of_vecto_2_2_and_vecto_3_0_1}
%=========================================================================

To compare the Driving behavior of Vecto~2.2 and Vecto~3.0.1 a number of simple driving cycles (about 2 -- 5\,km) have been used to visually compare the most important parameters such as 
\begin{itemize}
	\item Vehicle speed
	\item Acceleration
	\item Engine speed
	\item Gear
	\item Engine power and torque
	\item Fuel consumption
\end{itemize}
for two different vehicles: (i) 40t truck, and (ii) coach. The driving cycles tested are listed in \Cref{sec:driving_cycles_comparison}. \Cref{sec:comparison_vecto_2_2_and_vecto_3_0_1_on_the_basic_driving_cycles} contains graphs comparing the parameters listed above for Vecto~2.2 and Vecto~3.0.1 for the basic driving cycles.

\Cref{sec:comparison_of_vecto_2_2_and_vecto_3_0_1_on_the_declaration_cycle} shows a comparison of Vecto~2.2 and Vecto~3.0.1 for selected Declaration-Mode driving cycles (long-haul, regional delivery, and urban delivery) for different loadings and two different vehicles.

\Cref{sec:declaration_results_report_for_vecto_2_2_and_vecto_3_0_1} contains Declaration Reports for different Vecto jobs, generated with version~2.2 and version~3.0.1
