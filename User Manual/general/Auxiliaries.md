Auxiliaries
===========


In VECTO a generic map-based approach was implemented to consider all types of auxiliaries. The supply power demand for each single auxiliary is defined in the driving cycle. Hence a time/distance-dependent power demand can be defined. Based on the supply power and a pre-defined efficiency map the auxiliary input power is calculated. A constant efficiency determines the losses between auxiliary and engine.

For each auxiliary the power demand is calculated using the following steps:

1.  Auxiliary speed: **n~aux~ = n~Eng~ \* TransRatio**

2.  Auxiliary output power: **P~auxOut~ = P~supply~/EffToSply**

3.  Auxiliary input power: **P~auxIn~ = EffMap(n~Aux~, P~AuxOut~)**

4.  Auxiliary power consumption: **P~aux~ = P~auxIn~/EffToEng**

5.  **P~aux~ isÂ added to the engine's power demand**

Each auxiliary must be defined in the [Job File](../GUI/VECTO-Editor.html) and each [driving cycle](../fileformat/VDRI.html) used with this vehicle must include supply power for each auxiliary. To link the supply power in the driving cycle to the correct auxiliary in the Job File an ID is used. The corresponding supply power is then named *"&lt;Aux\_ID&gt;"*.


***Example:*** *The Auxiliary with the ID "ALT" (in the Job File) is linked to the supply power in the column "&lt;AUX\_ALT&gt;" in the driving cylce.*
