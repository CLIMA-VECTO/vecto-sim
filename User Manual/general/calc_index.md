Calculation Modes
=================


The Calculation Mode can be changed in the Options Tab of the [Main Form](#main-form). VECTO is running in Standard Mode when Batch Mode and Declaration Mode is disabled.

Note that [Engine Only Mode](#engine-only-mode) is not an actual calculation mode and can be set for each [Job File](#job-editor) individually and used in Standard and Batch Mode.

-   [Standard Mode](#standard-mode)
-   [Batch Mode](#batch-mode)
-   [Declaration Mode](#declaration-mode)
