Calculation Modes
=================


The Calculation Mode can be changed in the Options Tab of the [Main Form](../GUI/mainform.html). VECTO is running in Standard Mode when Batch Mode and Declaration Mode is disabled.

Note that [Engine Only Mode](EngOnlyMode.html) is not an actual calculation mode and can be set for each [Job File](../GUI/VECTO-Editor.html) individually and used in Standard and Batch Mode.

-   [Declaration Mode](calc_Declaration.html)
